                    In “First Man,” the last syllable of Gemini rhymes with knee and
                    everyone pronounces it that way,
                    including, from left, Corey Stoll, Lukas Haas and Ryan Gosling.

                    So which is it? How do you pronounce Gemini?
                    In “First Man,” the new film about the Neil 
                    Armstrong and the moon landing,
                    astronauts and NASA officials say “GEM-uh-knee.”
                    But the first pronunciation
                    in the Webster’s New World College Dictionary
                    Fifth Edition, the standard work
                    used by The New York Times to settle such
                    matters, the first pronunciation is
                    GEM-uh-neye,” which is the way many of us say
                    it. Or, to use the precise dictionary
                    typography, jem′ə nī΄ versus jem′ənē΄.Really,
                    though, which is right? 
                    The 10 crewed missions of the Gemini program,
                    with capsules that carried two people
                    into space in 1965 and 1966, never got the
                    attention that the programs before and after
                    it received. Mercury and the seven original
                    astronauts had Tom Wolfe as chronicler in
                    “The Right Stuff.” Apollo had the triumph of
                    the Moon landing, the tragedy of Apollo 1
                    and the nail-biting return of crippled Apollo
                    13.Gemini, by contrast, is the middle
                    child of the early space program, eager to
                    please but apt to be ignored. And when it
                    comes to saying the name aloud, there has
                    always been some knee-eye confusion. In this
                    newspaper, a seemingly authoritative 1965
                    article tried to resolve the “running debate”
                    with a statement from NASA that the proper
                    pronunciation is “‘Jiminy,’ as in ‘Jiminy
                    Cricket.’”

                        SUNDAY PUZZLE — The English language is a quirky one,
                        as anyone in an English as a
                        Second Language class can confirm.I’m sure other
                        languages have their own twists on
                        the rules of pronunciation, but English speakers
                        — and I’m looking in particular at
                        American English speakers, of which I am one — have
                        more exceptions to learn. Let’s look
                        at a classic example from “I Love Lucy” So it’s
                        confusing. Fortunately for us, the members
                        of Manhattan’s Jewish Association Serving the Aging
                        (J.A.S.A.) crossword class, ably mentored
                        by both Natan Last and Finn Vigeland, have constructed
                        a brilliant puzzle that will hopefully
                        clear things up.Mostly, it made me smile, and that’s
                        a good Sunday as far as I’m concerned.If
                        you are in the New York area and would like to learn
                        how to make your own crossword puzzle
                        from excellent, veteran Times constructors, the class
                        information and registration is below.
                        We’ve got more bang for the buck today and it really
                        highlights how many homophones and
                        homographs there are in the English language. Both
                        the entries and the clues include two
                        words that are spelled in ways that might lead you
                        to believe that they are pronounced similarly,
                        but they’re not.I really enjoyed this one, and
                        once you get the schtick, the theme is fairly
                        easy going. The only one I didn’t anticipate
                        was 109’s BASELINE VASELINE, which is an interesting
                        if not disgusting way to slide home, if you ask me.

                <h2>The Rabbit-Hole of ‘Relevant’</h2>
                <p>
                        When a law has a name like “Patriot” or “Freedom,”
                        it’s a sign that you should
                        read the fine print. Somewhere down there, in the
                        terraced subclauses of some
                        forgettable subsection, is a word with a special
                        meaning, a word that offers shelter
                        and concealment to whatever it is that the law actually
                        does. Consider the word
                        “relevant.” You and I use the word to distinguish what
                        matters (the relevant) from
                        what does not (the irrelevant). But to the National
                        Security Agency, there was no
                        irrelevant. Pointing to one appearance of the word
                        in a 2006 update of the USA
                        Patriot Act, the agency argued it could demand records
                        of any one of our phone
                        calls, on the very slight chance of some distant
                        connection to terrorism. A secret
                        court agreed, ordering phone companies to serve
                        up our records on an “ongoing daily
                        basis’’ — 24 hours a day, hundreds of billions
                        of calls in all. No one knew about
                        it until Edward Snowden revealed the existence
                        of the program in 2013. Earlier this
                        month, President Obama signed the USA Freedom
                        Act, which is supposed to close this
                        loophole. Will it? That depends on a fresh pile
                        of fine print.Congress created the
                        ‘relevant’ loophole soon after it learned of an
                        even larger loophole: the
                        free-for-all surveillance program put in place
                        after the Sept. 11 attacks. At
                        first, N.S.A. dragnet surveillance was so secret
                        that it didn’t really have a
                        name. It was simply known as ‘‘the Program’’ or
                        ‘‘the President’s Surveillance
                        Program’’ and later as ‘‘the Terrorist Surveillance
                        Program’’ or by the cover
                        term ‘‘Stellarwind.’’ As reported by the journalist
                        Shane Harris in his book
                        ‘‘The Watchers,’’ the N.S.A.’s data scientists came
                        to call it ‘‘the Big-Ass
                        Graph’’ for its tendency to generate ‘‘hairballs,’’
                        knotted webs of associations
                        that rarely added up to anything. The graph began
                        with phone ‘‘metadata’’
                        from Verizon and other U.S. carriers — whom their
                        customers called, where
                        they called from and for how long they talked. It
                        also included Internet
                        metadata, compelled from Silicon Valley firms, as
                        well as data from hotels,
                        car-rental companies, airlines and banks. In
                        thousands of cases, it went beyond
                        metadata to obtain the wiretapped content of
                        phone calls or emails.
